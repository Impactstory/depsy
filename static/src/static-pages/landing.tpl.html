                Depsy text-mines OA papers to find fulltext <em>mentions</em> of software they use,
                revealing impacts invisible to citation indexes like Google Scholar.

                Software reuse goes beyond citation&mdash;so Depsy analyzes code from
                over half a million GitHub repositories to find
                package imports, then uses PageRank to assess the importance of every
                package in the dependency network.

                Depsy assigns fractional credit to contributors based on designated authorship,<br>
                number of commits, and repo ownership&mdash;supporting a fairer, more software-native
                reward system.
